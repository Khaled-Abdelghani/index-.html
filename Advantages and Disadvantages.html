	<td>Data abstraction means, to hide the complexity of data from the basic users.
		DBMS abstracts the data to the users, which is not useful for the users. It shows only those data which are useful to the users.</td>
	<td>Data redundancy means having multiple copies of the same data.
		DBMS controls the data redundancy and integrates all data into a single database file.</td>
	<td>Data inconsistency means that different files may contain different information of a particular object or person
		If DBMS has reduced the data redundancy than the database system leads the better data consistency</td>
	<td>In DBMS, Data can be manipulated easily, because data is centralized so once the data structure is defined, we can easily change in the data like- insertion, modification or deletion.</td>
	<td>Data can be shared easily by multiple applications in centralized DBMS. The applications can be developed without having to create any new stored files.</td>
	<td>Database provides data security means protecting your precious data from unauthorized access. Data can be access only by authorized users of the organization.
		A database can be accessed only by proper authentication usually by verifying login and password.</td>
	<td>Multi-users can view the data at the same time.</td>
	<td>Several users can access the database concurrently.</td>

<h2>Disadvantages</h2>
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Cost of Hardware and Software</th>
    <th>Cost of Data Conversion</th>
    <th>Cost of Staff Training</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To run the DBMS software, we need a high-speed processor and large memory size is required which cause expensive hardware is needed.</td>
    <td>When a computer file-based system is replaced with a database system, then the data stored in data files must be converted into database files.
		It is the difficult and time-consuming method to convert the data of data files into database</td>
    <td>DBMS are often complex system, so the training is required for the users to use the DBMS.
		The organization has to be paid plenty of amount for the training of workers to run the database management system.</td>
